I've been gathering behavior-related resources for a couple of years - mostly due to my background in product management. I've found that understanding human behavior is *way* more important than the latest marketing tool or framework.

Visit the behaviors page on my GitHub page for the latest: https://bjpcjp.github.io/behaviors. Thank you!
